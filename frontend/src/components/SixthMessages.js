        We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between
        our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJ's, and many of us use
        Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and
        professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhD's, some are self-taught,
        and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared
        belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to
        something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.
